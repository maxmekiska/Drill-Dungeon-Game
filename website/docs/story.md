# The Story

## Introduction

Before diving into the game, it is important to highlight the objectives of your journey. You are herewith announced commander of your own drill. Congratulations commander! Your target is to explore and uncover the secrets buried in the endless depths of a new discovered planet. But be aware, this will be no ordinary recognisance mission.

Our scanners have picked up unknown structures deep below the surface. We are assuming that hostile life forms will be present as well.

However, there is also good news commander, spectral analysis of the crust layers have shown that minerals such as gold and coal are present. This is excellent news, since your drill will be running on coal to keep you and your crew alive. Gold on the other hand will surely come in handy to buy new upgrades from local non hostile life forms.
Our scientists made sure that your drill features the newest attack laser turret and modern plasma shield generator. These will make sure to protect you and your crew during your descent into the unknown.

Your main object herewith is to explore and scout the depths of the novel planet and report back all gathered data. We expect you to reach the core of the planet and come back safely. Good luck commander! We and your crew are counting on you!
