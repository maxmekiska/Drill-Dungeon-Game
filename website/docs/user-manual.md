# User Manual

## Introduction:

This guide will guide you through every step necessary to start up and enjoy the Drill Dungeon Game. We hope that you will enjoy your adventures through the depths of exciting but dangerous dungeons.

## Starting the game:

Make sure that you have followed the Installation guide before continuing with this section. Now, please navigate into the Drill Dungeons Folder and start up the main.py python file:

![](gifs/start-drill-game.gif)


You should now see a new window opening up which will bring you directly to the Drill Dungeon Game Main Menu.
On the main menu, you have the chance to click with a left mouse click on the instruction button which will display a short summary of all basic controls over which we will go now in detail. Furthermore, from the instruction menu you will be able to click on another summary that will display the main objectives of the game. If you wish to exit the game, just click on the exit button.
Please continue by clicking on the "Start Game" button with a right mouse click. The game will now begin:

Please have a look at the lower left corner. This is your HUD which will provide you with mission vital information and should be the best metric to decide tactical decisions during your adventure. The green bar represents your drills health. If the green bar is completely depleted your drill will explode and your mission failed:

So keep an eye on this metric before deciding to engage any further enemies. Below the green bar you will find your energy level that will power your shield. The shield will protect your drill from damage however it will not last forever. When depleted, the shield will disintegrate and leave you vulnerable to damage from enemies. But don't worry, your shield will recharge over time.

The values above health and the energy level will inform you about your drills inventory. Your inventory consists of Ammunition which supplies your turret with bullets. Coal, which severs as fuel for your drill and gold which can be used later in the game to purchase upgrades for your drill.
